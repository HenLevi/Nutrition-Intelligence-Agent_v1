Protein and Muscle Health – Practical Guide

Protein is essential for muscle repair, growth, and overall health.

General daily protein intake recommendations:
- Sedentary adults: ~0.8 g per kg body weight
- Physically active individuals: 1.2–1.6 g per kg
- Strength training / muscle gain: 1.6–2.2 g per kg

Protein after exercise:
- Consuming protein within 1–2 hours after training supports muscle recovery.
- Recommended post-workout intake: 20–40 grams of high-quality protein.

Common protein sources:
- Animal-based: eggs, chicken, fish, dairy, lean meat
- Plant-based: legumes, tofu, tempeh, quinoa, nuts

Protein distribution:
- Spreading protein intake evenly across meals improves muscle protein synthesis.

Adequate protein intake supports:
- Muscle recovery
