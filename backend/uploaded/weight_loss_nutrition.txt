Nutrition for Weight Loss

Weight loss occurs when energy intake is lower than energy expenditure.

Key principles:
- Maintain a moderate calorie deficit
- Prioritize protein intake to preserve muscle mass
- Choose high-fiber foods to increase satiety

Helpful dietary strategies:
- Eat vegetables at every meal
- Choose whole foods over processed foods
- Avoid liquid calories when possible

Protein and weight loss:
- Higher protein intake increases fullness
- Supports lean mass during calorie restriction

Consistency is more important than extreme dieting.
Sustainable habits lead to long-term success.
