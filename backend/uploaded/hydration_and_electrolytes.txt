💧 Hydration and Electrolytes – Practical Nutrition Guide
1. Importance of Hydration

Water is essential for nearly every function in the human body, including:

Regulation of body temperature

Transport of nutrients and oxygen

Removal of waste products

Joint lubrication

Cognitive performance and concentration

Cardiovascular function

Even mild dehydration can negatively affect physical performance, mood, and mental clarity.

2. Daily Water Intake Recommendations for Adults

General guidelines for healthy adults:

Men: approximately 2.5–3.0 liters per day

Women: approximately 2.0–2.5 liters per day

An alternative and widely used guideline is based on body weight:

30–35 ml of water per kilogram of body weight per day

Example:
A person weighing 70 kg → approximately 2.1–2.4 liters per day

These values include water from beverages and food.

3. Factors That Increase Water Needs

Daily water requirements may increase due to:

Physical activity and exercise

Hot or humid environments

Fever or illness

Pregnancy and breastfeeding

High-protein or high-fiber diets

Caffeine or alcohol consumption

During intense exercise or heat exposure, water needs may increase by 0.5–1.0 liters per hour.

4. Hydration and Physical Activity

Before exercise:

400–600 ml of water 2–3 hours before activity

Optional: 200–300 ml about 20 minutes before exercise

During exercise:

Under 60 minutes: water is usually sufficient

Over 60 minutes: include electrolytes

Typical intake: 150–250 ml every 15–20 minutes

After exercise:

Rehydrate according to sweat loss

General guideline: 1.25–1.5 liters of fluid per 1 kg of body weight lost

5. Electrolytes – Role and Importance

Electrolytes are minerals that help regulate:

Fluid balance

Muscle contraction

Nerve signaling

Heart rhythm

Key electrolytes include sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and chloride.

6. Sodium and Hydration

Sodium plays a critical role in maintaining fluid balance.

Significant sodium loss occurs during prolonged sweating

Excessive water intake without sodium replacement may lead to hyponatremia

For endurance activities:

Recommended sodium intake: 300–700 mg per hour

Common sources include electrolyte drinks, salted foods, and soups.

7. Potassium and Muscle Function

Potassium supports muscle contraction, nerve transmission, and blood pressure regulation.

Food sources include bananas, potatoes, avocados, leafy greens, and yogurt.

Low potassium levels may cause fatigue, muscle weakness, and cramps.

8. Magnesium and Recovery

Magnesium contributes to muscle relaxation, energy metabolism, and nervous system regulation.

Low magnesium levels may increase fatigue and muscle cramps.

Sources include nuts, seeds, whole grains, legumes, and dark chocolate.

9. Signs of Dehydration

Early signs:

Thirst

Dry mouth

Dark yellow urine

Fatigue

Severe signs:

Dizziness

Confusion

Rapid heartbeat

Reduced urine output

Urine color is a simple hydration indicator:

Pale yellow → well hydrated

Dark yellow → dehydration

10. Overhydration (Hyponatremia)

Excessive water intake without adequate electrolytes can dilute blood sodium levels.

Risk factors include endurance sports, long-duration events with water-only intake, and heavy sweating combined with low-sodium diets.

Symptoms may include headache, nausea, confusion, and in severe cases, seizures.

11. Hydration in Special Populations

Older adults:

Reduced thirst sensation

Higher risk of dehydration

Should drink regularly, even without feeling thirsty

Children:

Higher fluid loss relative to body size

Require frequent hydration during play and sports

Pregnancy and breastfeeding:

Increased fluid needs

Additional 300–700 ml per day is commonly recommended

12. Practical Hydration Tips

Drink consistently throughout the day

Carry a water bottle

Monitor urine color

Combine water intake with meals

Use electrolyte drinks during long or intense activity

Adjust intake based on activity level and environment

13. Summary

Hydration needs vary depending on body weight, activity level, environment, and health status.
Water is essential for daily function, while electrolytes become increasingly important during prolonged sweating or intense physical activity.
Balanced hydration supports performance, recovery, and overall health.
