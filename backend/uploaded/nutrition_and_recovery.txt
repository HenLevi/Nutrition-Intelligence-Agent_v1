Nutrition and Recovery

Recovery is a critical part of physical adaptation.

Key factors supporting recovery:
- Adequate calorie intake
- Sufficient protein
- Proper hydration
- Quality sleep

Carbohydrates help restore muscle glycogen after exercise.
Micronutrients support recovery processes:
- Magnesium supports muscle relaxation
- Potassium supports muscle function
- Sodium supports fluid balance

Poor recovery may lead to fatigue, decreased performance, and increased injury risk.
