Pre and Post Workout Nutrition

Nutrition around exercise improves performance and recovery.

Before exercise:
- Eat 2–3 hours before training if possible
- Focus on carbohydrates for energy and moderate protein
- Avoid heavy fats and large meals close to exercise

Examples of pre-workout meals:
- Oatmeal with fruit
- Yogurt with banana
- Rice with lean protein

After exercise:
- Combine protein and carbohydrates
- Protein supports muscle repair
- Carbohydrates replenish glycogen stores

Examples of post-workout meals:
- Chicken with rice
- Yogurt with fruit
- Protein shake with carbohydrates

Hydration before and after exercise is also essential for recovery.
