Electrolytes and Muscle Cramps

Electrolytes regulate muscle contraction and nerve signaling.

Common electrolytes:
- Sodium
- Potassium
- Magnesium

Electrolyte imbalance may contribute to muscle cramps, especially during intense or prolonged exercise.

During long or intense training sessions:
- Electrolyte-containing beverages may be beneficial
- Sodium losses increase with sweating

Balanced hydration supports muscle function and performance.
